Set of small utilities that I use on my ubuntu desktop. Most of them should work on linux systems. But some of them also have gtk dependency.

Here is the explanations for the scripts

* alemfm : Plays alemfm radio with mplayer. you should install mplayer for this to work.
* cornercam: Shows a webcam video on the corner of the screen. Got script from [metalx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpCEi6cabo8)
* screencast: saves screen cast to a file. Got script from [metalx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhWXVA7OI6E)
* gmailnotifier: This script shows a little notification on the corner of the screen if you have a new mail in your mailbox. Notification shows how many new mail you got. You can also categorize emails according to their senders. In order to use this command you have to edit the file and put your authantication informaion inside.
